### - An ordered collection of characters used to store and represent text-and-bytes based info

### - they are part of the larger class of sequences aka you can perform sequence operations on them

1. they are immutable AKA cannot be changed in place
2. they contain unicode characters, encoded in UTF-9
3. they are a Python sequence- we can iterate over them (character by character), retrieve their elements via numeric indexes and search in them with the in operator
